# 🚀 Mission MEA – Multi-Level Planning Game

**Mission MEA** is an interactive web-based educational game designed to demonstrate the concept of **Means-Ends Analysis (MEA)** — a fundamental AI problem-solving technique. The game enables users to plan a series of actions to transition from an initial state to a goal state using logical reasoning, supported by a built-in quiz to reinforce learning..

## 🧠 What is Means-Ends Analysis?

Means-Ends Analysis (MEA) is an artificial intelligence strategy that breaks down the gap between the current state and the desired goal state by choosing actions (means) that reduce that gap step-by-step.
